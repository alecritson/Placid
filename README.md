# README

Placid is a Craft plugin which makes it easy to use REST services in your twig templates, whether thats getting a twitter feed, showing off dribbble shots or getting the weather, Placid has you covered.

## IMPORTANT
This version of Placid will now remain as is, development of version 2.0.0 is underway and since it's a complete rewrite and since the latest version of the OAuth plugin by Dukt has introduced quite a number of breaking issues relating to access tokens, it would be counter productive to try and fix them all, instead I will be focusing on the next version of Placid.

You can still download this version and things will of course work as expected, but if you want to use OAuth for twitter then you should download the [`0.9.60` release of the OAuth plugin here](https://github.com/dukt/craft-oauth/releases/tag/0.9.60) to be sure things will work correctly.

> I will still fix bugs in this version that **do not** relate to the OAuth plugin, so feel free to post issues if you need to!
