# README

Placid is a Craft plugin which makes it easy to use REST services in your twig templates, whether thats getting a twitter feed, showing off dribbble shots or getting the weather, Placid has you covered.

**Given the announcement of Craft 3, Placid 2 will wait and during this time I will be working on bringing this version of Placid up to scratch, stay tuned!**

#### `1.3.5` is released
This now has support for the latest version of the OAuth plugin from Dukt, as of testing `0.9.71` is working. But any issues just give us a shout! [You can get the latest release here](https://github.com/alecritson/Placid/releases/tag/1.3.2)

**Support for custom headers**  
You can also now set your own headers to be sent with the request.

**Custom dashboard widgets**  
You can now create your own dashboard widgets based on requests you have set up. [See how its done](https://github.com/alecritson/Placid/wiki/Widgets)
